Kurikirana is a platform that will allow you to track your food items' health remotely. It leverages IoT sensors to send realtime data of temperature and humidity which are two of the main factors that cause premature spoiling.

##Deployment Process
###Cloud Deployment (For Production)

For the frontend, I'll host it on Vercel because it's easy to integrate with GitHub, and it automatically rebuilds and redeploys whenever I push changes. It also gives me a free domain and SSL for security.
For the backend, I'll use Render or Railway, which are great for hosting Node.js applications with a free tier. I'll push my backend code to GitHub, connect it to Render, and deploy it from there. The API will then be publicly accessible, and my frontend can easily communicate with it.

For the database, I'll go with MySQL and use PlanetScale, Railway, or Supabase‚Äîall of these offer managed databases, so I don‚Äôt have to worry about setup and maintenance. I‚Äôll just connect my backend to one of these services, run my migrations, and I‚Äôm good to go.

###Local Deployment 

To acces the platform simply follow these steps:

1. Clone the repositpry

``` git clone https://github.com/TetaDory/Kurikirana.git ```


2. Navigate to the repo

``` cd Kurikirana ```

3. Create a virtual environment

``` python3 -m venv venv ```

4. Activate the virtual environment

``` venv\Scripts\activate  ```

5. Install Requirements

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

6. Run the app

``` flask run ```

And for the database, I can either install MySQL locally or use Docker to spin up a MySQL instance like this:


``` docker run --name food-db -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=food_tracker -p 3306:3306 -d mysql ```


After, I'll run my database migrations to set up the necessary tables.


Infrastructure Overview
Frontend: React (Hosted on Vercel)
Backend: Node.js + Express (Hosted on Rend√üer/Railway)
Database: MySQL (Managed via PlanetScale, Railway, or Supabase)
CI/CD: I could use GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
Authentication: Firebase/Auth0
